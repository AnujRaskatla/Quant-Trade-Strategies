# Pair Trading Strategy using Z-Score:
  - **Overview:**
    - `MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)` : MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. It consists of the MACD line, signal line, and histogram.

    - `RSI (Relative Strength Index)` : RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a stock.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `Short Window` : The time period used to calculate the short-term Exponential Moving Average (EMA) in the MACD calculation.
    - `Long Window` : The time period used to calculate the long-term EMA in the MACD calculation.
    - `Signal Window` : The time period used to calculate the signal line in the MACD calculation.
    - `RSI Window` : The time period used to calculate the RSI.
  - **Logic:**
    - MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
	When to Buy:
	Bullish Crossover: A buy signal is generated when the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This indicates increasing bullish 	momentum and is considered a potential entry point for long positions.
	Positive Divergence: If the price of the asset makes a new low while the MACD histogram forms a higher low, it suggests that the 	downward momentum is weakening, which can be interpreted as a bullish signal.
	When to Sell:
	Bearish Crossover: A sell signal occurs when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. This indicates increasing bearish 	momentum and is considered a potential exit point for long positions.
	Negative Divergence: If the price of the asset makes a new high while the MACD histogram forms a lower high, it suggests that the 	upward momentum is weakening, which can be interpreted as a bearish signal.

	RSI (Relative Strength Index)
	When to Buy:
	Oversold Condition: RSI readings below 30 typically indicate that a stock is oversold. A buy signal is generated when the RSI 	crosses above 30 after being in the oversold region, suggesting that the downward pressure may be easing and a potential reversal 	to the upside may occur.
	When to Sell:
	Overbought Condition: RSI readings above 70 generally indicate that a stock is overbought. A sell signal is generated when the RSI 	crosses below 70 after being in the overbought region, suggesting that the upward momentum may be slowing down and a potential 	reversal to the downside may occur.
  - **Code:**
    - [macd.py](macd.py): Python script containing the strategy code.
  - **Usage:**
    - EEnsure you have the necessary libraries: Make sure you have installed the required Python libraries, namely pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. You can install them using pip if you haven't already:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
Update the path to your data file: In the example usage provided in the README, there's a line where you read the stock data from a CSV file:
df = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv')
Replace 'stock_data.csv' with the path to your actual data file. Ensure that your data file contains at least two columns: 'Date' and 'Close', representing the date and closing prices of the stock, respectively.

Adjust the parameters (optional): You can adjust the parameters for the MACD and RSI calculations according to your preferences. These parameters include the short window, long window, signal window for MACD, and the window for RSI. These parameters are passed as arguments to the calculate_macd and calculate_rsi functions.

Customize the plotting (optional): You can customize the plotting code to suit your preferences. This includes changing colors, adding titles, adjusting the figure size, etc. The provided code already contains basic plotting instructions for visualizing the stock's close price, MACD, signal line, and RSI.
