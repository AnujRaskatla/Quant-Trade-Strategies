### 1. Overview

- This repository aims to explore and implement quantitative trading strategies for financial markets.
- Strategies are designed to leverage historical market data to make informed trading decisions.
- Implemented in Python, the code is well-structured and documented for users to easily comprehend and adapt.

### 2. Getting Started

- To get started, clone this repository to your local machine.
  
  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
- Install dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Follow the instructions in the README files of individual strategy directories.

### 3. Directory Structure

- **data/**: Contains sample datasets and instructions on obtaining market data.
- **strategies/**: Each subdirectory represents a different trading strategy.
- **backtesting/**: Includes scripts for evaluating strategy performance.
  
### 4. Usage
  1. Replace 'your_data.csv' in the script with the actual file path or URL of your historical stock price data.
  2. Run the script: 'your_strategy_script.py'
  3. View the model evaluation results and visualization in the console and generated plot.

## 5. Strategies

- **MeanReversion/**: Implements a mean-reversion trading strategy.
  - `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the strategy, parameters, and logic.
  - `mean_reversion.py`: Python script containing the strategy code.

- **TrendFollowing/**: Implements a trend-following trading strategy.
  - `README.md`: Comprehensive overview of the strategy.
  - `trend_following.py`: Python script for the strategy.
    
- **SMA (Simple Moving Average):** based on SMA crossovers, aiming to generate buy and sell signals.
  - [`README.md`](strategies/SMA/README.md): Comprehensive overview of the strategy.
  - [`sma_script.py`](strategies/SMA/sma_script.py): Python script containing the strategy.
    
## 6. ML Prediction Models
  

### 7. Backtesting


- The `backtesting/` directory contains scripts for evaluating the performance of each strategy.
- Detailed instructions on running backtests are provided in the README.
